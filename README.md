A camera system has a Raspberry Pi computer, 3 cameras, and 2 DC motors. It performs the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB, Gait Speed, Standing Balance, 5 Times Sit Stand) and Timed Up and Go tests. There are graphical user interfaces and programs, all in Python.

Reproducing this depends on having a similar hardware set up and a camera calibration described in 

    pi/Desktop/CALIBRATION OF CAMERAS.txt.  

Some code would have to be adapted to particular hardwares. A few programs can run without hardware.

Most important operations are accessible through graphical user interface (GUI) programs (.py) on the Desktop.
There are help files accessible with buttons in the GUIs.
Many programs are in md4 folder. There are some programs which are extra.

The folders and files are in the relative locations where they were used in a Raspberry Pi computer, but empty folders do not copy to GitHub.
These are the folders and subfolders needed in a Raspberry Pi to be able to use this code.
You must create any folders that are missing on GitHub. Please see the file,  

    pi/Desktop/MISSING FOLDERS.txt.
