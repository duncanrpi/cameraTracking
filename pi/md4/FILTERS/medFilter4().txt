# medFilter4() tries to preserve the extreme values at the edges of a sequence,
# but still do some medFilter there. The exceptions are the very first and last 
# values which are medFilter in nearby group of 3.

# In this file,
# x is an input list with length = len(x).
# n is the number of points being medFilter each time.
# y is an output list with length = len(x).
# The length is not reduced.

# numbers far enough inside to be in the middle of n numbers
#  are medFilter with those numbers (groups of n).
# For numbers not far enough inside, they are in the middle of an 
#  odd number of numbers. They are medFilter with those numbers. 

# first & last numbers are medFilter with 2 adjacent values (groupss of 3)
# if n>3, numbers next to first & last are medFilter with adjacent numbers (groups of 3)
# if n>5, numbers 2nd from first & last are medFilter with adjacent numbers (groups of 5), etc.


# x is the input array. n = 2K + 1, the filter size. y is the output array.
# Required: n >= 3. n is odd. len(x) > n.
