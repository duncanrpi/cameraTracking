The folders and files are in the relative locations where they were used in a Raspberry Pi computer, but empty folders do not copy to GitHub.

Also, a file, haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml, must be downloaded from 
https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
and placed in the Raspberry Pi at this location (you may have to create haarcascades folder) :
/home/pi/md4/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

These are the folders and subfolders needed in a Raspberry Pi to be able to use this code.
You must create any folders that are missing on GitHub. Please see the following folder list. Indents indicate levels.
